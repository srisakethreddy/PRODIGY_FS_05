📸 MySocial – Task 05: Social Media Platform
MySocial is a client-side social media platform built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no frameworks or backend required. Users can log in, create posts with images or videos, follow others, like and comment on posts, search by hashtags, and much more. Everything runs directly in the browser using localStorage and IndexedDB.

🌐 Live Demo (optional):
